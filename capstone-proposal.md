Btn Buddy

Project's Purpose or Goal: 

Btn Buddy helps the CSS averse to create custom buttons. The website will use an easy interactive button selector to customize CSS properties and generate the code to copy and paste into the user's stylesheet. 

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

- Allow users to customize their buttons by selecting options for button color, border, shape, alignment, padding, size, and hover effect.
- Generate the CSS to be copied into the user's stylesheet.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

-Figma
-Adobe Illustrator
-HTML / CSS
-Javascript
-React
-Styled Components
-(Typescript)*

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

- Adding animations to the website and including button animations to the selector options.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
